Sun,THE SUN,"The sun is by far the largest object in our solar system, containing 99.8% of the solar system's mass. It sheds most of the heat and light that makes life possible on Earth and possibly elsewhere. Planets orbit the sun in oval-shaped paths called ellipses, with the sun slightly off-center of each ellipse. 

NASA has a fleet of spacecraft observing the sun, such as the Parker Solar Probe, to learn more about its composition, and to make better predictions about space weather and its effect on Earth.","In ancient times the Sun was widely seen as a god, and the name for Sun was the name of that god",1.3927 million km,240 million years,36 Earth days,8,./sun-1.jpg,./sun-2.jpg
